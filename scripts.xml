This script has been written and tested with Steam - Halo: MCC - Halo 2. The button layout I use is Recon, you can modify the button mapping as needed. In the future, I will write in commented button layouts so you can choose your layout.

Right now when you load this, the BXR and Doubleshot Button Combos are written. Starting the script has them turned on by default. Clicking the Right DPAD will turn off/on Doubleshot and clicking the Left DPAD will turn off/on the BXR.

I will in time write in plausible menu features, but I am making this quite simple as Halo 2 Classic is very outdated.</DES><RTP>0</RTP><RTM>1</RTM><UTM>1662218280</UTM><DOW>67</DOW><NOT>Initial Release of the script.</NOT><VER>1.00</VER><UNM>silentslay</UNM><TID>0</TID></S><S><SID>12389</SID><UID>455251</UID><NAM>YOU'RE JUST BETTER V59.2: ScottishTryHard 32_Bit V4.1</NAM><DES>YOU'RE JUST BETTER V59.2: ScottishTryHard 32_Bit V4.1 EDITION BY DOMEKILLER</DES><RTP>12</RTP><RTM>6</RTM><UTM>1661998350</UTM><DOW>2160</DOW><NOT>Credits: Crescens and Taylor compiled by scripts of many others credit goes to the cronus community.</NOT><VER>59.2</VER><UNM>DOMEKILLER</UNM><TID>0</TID></S><S><SID>12388</SID><UID>455251</UID><NAM>YOU'RE JUST BETTER V59.2: ScottishTryHard 32_Bit V4.1</NAM><DES>YOU'RE JUST BETTER V59.2: ScottishTryHard 32_Bit V4.1 EDITION BY DOMEKILLER</DES><RTP>4</RTP><RTM>4</RTM><UTM>1661997824</UTM><DOW>662</DOW><NOT>Crescens and Taylor compiled by scripts of many others credit goes to the cronus community.</NOT><VER>59.2</VER><UNM>DOMEKILLER</UNM><TID>0</TID></S><S><SID>12387</SID><UID>558993</UID><NAM>fifa 22</NAM><DES>fifa 22 Skills moves</DES><RTP>4</RTP><RTM>3</RTM><UTM>1661941436</UTM><DOW>709</DOW><NOT>hij werkt goed</NOT><VER>2.05</VER><UNM>Olaf bode</UNM><TID>0</TID></S><S><SID>12386</SID><UID>570771</UID><NAM>RUST Pedro's Nightmare 4.0   32 Bit</NAM><DES>Join the discord for help. https://discord.gg/6wvvgJU4ZM
